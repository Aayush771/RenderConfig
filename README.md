# P.R.A.G.N.A. - Proactive Review and Analysis for Guiding Next-generation Assessments

---

PRAGNA( **sankrit/samskrutam for Enhanced Perception** ) is a tool designed to enhance the perception of code quality and provide proactive review and analysis for guiding next-generation assessments.

## Features

- **Code Quality Assessment**: PRAGNA assesses the quality of internal code projects by analyzing various aspects such as code structure, naming conventions, cohesion, coupling, and more.
  
- **Inline Suggestions**: Provides actionable inline suggestions to improve code readability, organization, and efficiency.
  
- **CheckStyle Analysis**: Evaluates code against predefined standards and provides feedback on violations including line numbers where improvements can be made.
  
- **Summary of Strengths and Improvements**: Summarizes the strengths found in the code structure and identifies areas for improvement, helping developers focus on enhancing code reusability and commenting practices.
  
- **Dark/Light Mode Support**: Toggle between dark and light modes for comfortable viewing.

## Problem Solved

PRAGNA addresses the challenge of maintaining high code quality standards by automating the review process. It helps developers identify and rectify potential issues early in the development lifecycle, thereby reducing technical debt and improving overall software maintainability.
